# Milestone2 Marvelfun

[This website](https://volkovbos.github.io/milestone2_are_you_a_hero/index.html) was created for everyone who is an MCU or comics fan, as me. It gives you some brief information about why I like it so much and some information about the characters in the movies. And as last a simple but enjoyable game to see which character matches with your answers on a few questions.

## DESIGN

### FRAMEWORK

I used Bootstrap for the navbar and for the modals.

### COLOR SCHEME

The color scheme I chose is a grey palette.

-   `#777777`   (light grey)
-   `#F0131E`   (Marvel red)
-   `#FFF`      (white fonts)
-   `#2B2B2B`   (darkest grey, shadows)

As the main font I chose for the [Avengero Font](https://fontmeme.com/fonts/avengero-font/) designed by Gene Buban.
For the secondary font I used Comic Sans Ms, not ofter used but for the subject of this website very justifiable, and gives a playful character.


### WIREFRAMES

I used MS Excel to create my wireframes and put them in a separate folder [Wireframes](https://github.com/VolkovBos/milestone2_are_you_a_hero/tree/master/wireframes).


## UX

This site is for general users who want to have a bit of fun and play a simple game in the form of a questionnaire.
